# TravelAgency
The system will provide the users the
opportunity to plan their trips. The system enables users to reserve a tour by themselves
or through an agent of the company, later they can edit and update the reservations. The
reservations can be made for the hotel rooms or the tours. The tour will include several
sightseeing places that are usually visited by tourists. Along with that, they will also have
the ability to participate in activities like festivals and concerts. After the tour is over the
user will be able to review the tour or the guide and rate them. The guide will also have
the right to add feedback about the tour. To make things easier and beneficial for the
agency we added multiple features to make the system more convenient and easier to
use. For example, a discount can be applied to any reservation made by a customer,
which can help the agency promote its tours. In summary, we provide in our system what
most travel agencies would need, from reservations to activities and sightseeing places,
to discounts for the reservations.
